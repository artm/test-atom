# README

Test the file watcher by changing the `README.md` on `feature` branch, then
executing the `repro` script.

NOTE: the `repro` script is intentionally kept very simple and will break on
merge conflicts. The simplest way to avoid merge conflicts is to add new text
to the README as new text lines.
